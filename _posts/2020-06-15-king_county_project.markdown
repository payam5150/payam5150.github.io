Time truly flies! I am now more than 4 months into the Data Science program. You know, the last time that I took statistics was back when I was finishing up my undergrad. Let's just say that Saved by the Bell was still around =) 

To me, statistics has always been a very interesting subject. Everything is based on statistics and we are using it more than ever due to this crazy virus that has taken over all of our lives. Each day, we are getting new reports of new cases and which states are at a higher risk. Sorry, I am a bit off topic haha...

Let's talk about the King County project. Since I have a license in Real Estate, this project was very interesting to me. We had to go through 21,000+ records of various homes and clean them up. Many of the fields had no value and some had a "?" which could not be used when working on this project. Furthermore, some of the columns were not even needed. After the cleanup, I was able to put the puzzle together to see what I was looking at. Slowly, the entire dataset started to make sense. I was able to showcase the most expensive homes and the least expensive homes. This is an important information for either buyers or sellers. Furthermore, I realized that homes with a waterfront view sold for more. Depending on oneâ€™s budget, I am able to draw a picture of what is expected when trying to sell, invest or purchase a new house. I am able to show case historical data and forecast a price range for all the potential clients.

For the future work, I do want to know the job market in King County. Why? Because we are currently in recession (2020). When in recession, one market that gets hits hard is the housing market. A seasoned agent will do their due diligence to bring up all the factors for future investors.

All in all, this was a fun project and I can't wait to present it to the best instructor, Eli. I am fairly excited that we are now half way through the program and I can't wait to graduate.
