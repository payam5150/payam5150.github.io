As many of you know by now, Data Science is not an easy degree. Then again, if it was easy, I guess everyone would be doing it. Being a Data Scientist separates you from others. Sitting on your computer, cracking codes, analyzing data, scratching your head over and over when a code does not work, then, **BAM**, you think of a solution and what do you know, it ***RUNS*!!!** Everything that I have listed above, truly opens your mind. 

Just like our muscles grow in the gym from working out, our brain also needs to exercise. Unlike most in my program, I do not have a programming background, but I have always been in love with data and analyzing it. I have struggled more than most to understand the concept of my labs and how to code. Many times, I wanted to give up. Many times, it gave me anxiety. Many times, I felt as this was not for me. Thankfully, my 2 coaches **Eli** and **Dara** worked with me weekly and encouraged me to keep going. I steady did the labs. Finished 2 sections as I promise Eli per week. I worked more on understanding the concepts rather than being a coder and once I understood the concepts, the coding started to make more sense. 

In order to succeed in this program, you must stay **consistent**. As my coach said, this is not a race but a marathon. Each day, I challenge my brain. I work on labs, I go on google to read more about coding, I watch youtube videos and every single day, I feel as the program is getting easier and easier. I have long ways to go and I will forever be a **STUDENT**, but, I am now able to manage my time much better.  Will I struggle more? Absoultly! I am supposed to, but, thats how you grow....
