To be honest, when I first looked at the Mod 1 project, I did not know if I could get it done. I mean, I knew how to present it and I understood the concept but the technical part looked like a monster to me. 

I thought to myself, who am I kidding? Maybe coding is not for me. Unlike most of my classmates, I come from a business background. So, how was I going to tackle this monster? Often, I was afraid to even turn the computer on because the codes gave me anxiety. Just looking at them, it looked as if a new dimension had opened and I was trying to break the codes of law. Thankfully, I was fortunate enough to have an amazing support team. A team who did not judge me for my lack of knowledge in programming. An instructor who pushed me every Monday to keep me in tune with the program. 

I attended group meetings. I watched many YouTube videos. I spoke to my Data Scientist friends around me until one day, **BAM**, things started to click. I used to wake up at 3am every morning with anxiety but my wake ups turned from fear to excitements. WOW, things are starting to click! Maybe this monster is not as bad as it seems. 

So, what did I learn from Mod 1? Besides finally learning how to web scrape, analyzing data and build pretty little graphs? I learned that **you donâ€™t have to be great to start but you have to start to be great**. I learned that it is OK not to know everything. I learned that it is OK to reach out to friends if I am in need of help. I learned that when I see a huge set of codes, not to be afraid of it and instead, smile, sit and read each line of code one by one and understand what it is doing. I learned that if you break down each line of code, it starts to make sense and becomes a lot easier. 

I am still fresh in this program and have a lot to learn but I feel as Mod 1 put a positive pressure on me to keep learning and learning. It gave me a great understating on what the companies seek when they hire a consultant. Well done, Flatiron!
