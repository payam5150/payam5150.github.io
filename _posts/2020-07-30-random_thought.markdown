So, it's July 30th, 2020. A day before I celebrate my birthday. This year has been very interesting to say the least. So many events have gotten cancelled. So many of my trips that I was looking forward had to be cancelled but one thing that I am proud of is that I am almost done with the Data Science program. This has been on my bucket list for a few years and since there are no distractions with friends being out and partying, it has actually helped me focus more on the program. Those of you who are in this program can vouch that it is not easy. It is not easy but it is worth it. In my opinion, this program teaches us much more than coding. It teaches us discipline. It teaches us to be patient. It teaches us about future careers. It teaches us how to market ourselves. As the title says, this blog is nothing but my random thoughts for todayâ€¦. Thought I would step away from coding and do some writing =)
