I chose Heat-Maps as my favorite visualization technique. After reading more about it, by definition, â€œHeat-Maps are graphical representations of data that utilize color-coded systems." The main purpose of a Heat-Map is to visualize the volume of locations or various events. For example, currently, we are using Heat-Maps when describing all the spots that the coronavirus has hit the most or least.  In my opinion, it paints a great picture on all the spots where this virus has hit the most. When they show the spots in red, it automatically draws your attention to it. It also makes it easy to understand the relationships between data points and draw conclusions about overall trends. One weakness that Heat-Map may have is when they use an excessive use of its colors. In my opinion, it can hurt your eyes. ![](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.inquirer.com%2Fhealth%2Fcoronavirus%2Fcoronavirus-johns-hopkins-map-world-cases-20200319.html&psig=AOvVaw0D6MiGOL4yGthafLnhUlQd&ust=1585871811608000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLCNtIK3yOgCFQAAAAAdAAAAABADhttp://)
