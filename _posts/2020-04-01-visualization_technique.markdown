When it comes to Visualization Techniques, I chose Heat-Maps as my favorite. After reading more about it, by definition, â€œHeat-Maps are graphical representations of data that utilize color-coded systems." The main purpose of a Heat-Map is to visualize the volume of locations and various events. For example, currently, we are using Heat-Maps when describing all the spots that the coronavirus has hit the most or least.  In my opinion, it paints a great picture on all the areas in the US and around the world where this virus has affected people the most. When they show the spots in red, it automatically draws your attention to it. It also makes it easy to understand the relationship between data points as it draws a conclusions about the overall trend. One weakness that Heat-Maps may have is when they use the colors excessively. In my opinion, it can hurt your eyes and hard to follow.
