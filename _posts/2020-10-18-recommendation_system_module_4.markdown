Well, I did it, I hope...

I started this program clueless and now, I feel really comfortable knowing that I am months away from graduating. I decided to finish Module 4 a week early as I am about to take 2 weeks of back to back vacations.

Why did I choose this topic? Simple! The entire world is working off the recommendation system. Just today, as I went to purchase a simple item from Amazon, I ended up buying 5 new items based on what they were recommending me. Did I need them? Maybe... Was it helpful? 100%   

Do you know how many amazing comedians I have discovered on Youtube based on what they recommended me? Do you know how many amazing movies I have watched based on this algorithm? Has it cost me a lot of money? Yes! I have purchased items from Instagram, facebook, amazon, etc… but to be honest, I do not regret any of them. 

Now that I know how it works behind the scene, I am interested in building more and more systems…
Maybe after reading this blog, you may be interested in readying more of my blogs ;)  I highly recommend them ;)
