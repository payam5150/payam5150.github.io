It's 10:50pm here in Dallas and I have decided to write a random blog. A few weeks ago, I lost a good friend who was also my mentor. He is the reason that I did not quit early on in the program. Since he has been gone, I have lost my grind in this program eventhough we have some of the most amazing instructors who are now teaching us. I guess I am still trying to get used to him being gone. I am now a bit behind on my assignments but I am finally getting back in the groove since I made a promise to Eli that I would finish the program. We are now about 3 months away from graduating and I like to dedicate this certification to him. I know that he is up yelling at all of us with "please write your daily's" or "we are all in this together" or "folks, it's an honor to teach you." Anyway, we miss you, friend! As promised, the entire class is helping one another as you have always wanted. I did well on my Mod3 and will start on Mod4 soon... Your friend, always, Payam
