In 2003, I accepted a job with JC Penney's as a Logistics Analyst. I was a young kid with no real life experience in the corporate world. Once I was hired, I was introduced to my manager by the name of Al. He met with me and asked if I knew how to build databases. I looked at him with a confused look and right there, he knew that it was going to be a long journey between the 2 of us. He then started to train me each day with grabbing data using tables from the IT department and connecting them with ours in MS Access (ODBC). He was harsh on me, he drained me, but in 2 years, I was building most of the databases in our department. I created queries, built reports from them and met with the directors and presented my findings in regards to profits and our overheads. A few years later, I got a promotion and accepted a job as a Sr. Analyst with Ericsson. Because of my background, I had over 700 contractors under me as I was the liaison between our vendors and field directors. I knew then how powerful data was and how it would take over the future. After many years, I had saved up enough money to buy my own business and in 2011, I opened up a sandwich shop. I ran it for about 3 years until I decided to go back into the corporate world again. Sadly, I am now either over qualified or under qualified in my field to move up in my career. I have always loved data and after looking into the data science program, I feel as itâ€™s exactly what I need to take me to the next level in my career.  **
