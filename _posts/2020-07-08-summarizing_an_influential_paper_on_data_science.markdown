I recently read an article that was written by Alan M. Garber on Data Science: What the Educated Citizen Needs to Know. In the article, it predicts that soon, machines would surpass humans at determining guilt and innocence. It even gives an example of machines replacing human juries in a court room. Could the machine make a determination of guilt. How would an AI tell the story? Although we are not there yet, at a recent dinner filled with professionals, they all predicted that one day, this will be reality. They discuss that currently, our phones are already identifying family members and friends in photos and that our phones already warn us that we need to leave early for our next appointment because traffic is heavier than usual. 

Could you imagine 20 years ago that our phones would be doing this today? Furthermore, according to the article, companies that develop and adopt AI technologies will increase their cash flow by about 122% between 2020 and 2030. Because of this, more and more students are getting into the field of computer science, Statistics and Data Science. The artical also predicts that Data Science will keep growing as the years come due to the high demand.

The article also states that Intelligent systems may not perform as well as the human mind at some pattern recognition tasks or at recognizing the emotional states of other people. Some skills that humans acquire without apparent effort remain beyond the capabilities of machines. But intelligent systems are making rapid progress toward gaining such skills and are already superior at many other tasks. Deep learning and other machine learning techniques have inherent advantages, but providing a simple explanation is not among them. They are powerful tools, especially for prediction and pattern recognition. Their primary purpose is not to elucidate mechanisms or to explain why they give the results they do. By avoiding the functional form restrictions and relatively simple model specifications of traditional applied statistics, they optimize for the tasks they are known for.

Last, the article also talks about the future of human employement. Historically, technological change has led to the creation of new jobs as existing jobs were rendered obsolete. But if future technological innovations have more dramatic and far-reaching effects, jobs may be lost to automation more quickly than attractive new opportunities become available. 

The benefits of data science are real and have never been more important. Increasingly accurate predictions will make the products of data science more valuable than ever, and will increase interest in the field. Cheers to the future...
