First, let's define what model section, model validation and hyperparameter mean for all the future data scientists...

Why do we call them Model hyperparameters? By definition, they are often referred to as parameters because they are the parts of the machine learning that must be set manually and tuned. An example of a parameter would be like an average that describes the entire population. The ultimate goal for any machine learning model is to learn from examples in such a manner that the model is capable of generalizing the learning to new instances which it has not yet seen. 

An example of this could be found in the dataset entitled “titanic.csv.” In it, you will find individuals who were on board on the Titanic. We used this as our entire population and start to observe how the point estimates from various samples of this population behave. When bringing in the data, we were able to do an average of the age of the passengers, what the average gender was, how many passengers were on the ship and so on. We can do this to any data set and this type of learning is used in almost everything.
