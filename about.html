<p>I have bachelor's degree in Business Logistics and a master's degree in Strategics Leadership. I've worked in the corporate world as an Analyst for over 20 years but in 2010, I decided to open my own restaurant to be my own boss. Long story short, that's how I ended up with so many gray hairs. I own a music label, I have my license in Real Estate and I invest whenever I can but to be honest, I have always loved data analytics. Life is too short to stay steady, thus, I am challenge hungry... Ohh, and go Cowboys =P </p>
